    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, and cornstarch together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir tenderloin strips in hot oil until just browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate and return the wok to heat.</li>
        <li>Add remaining sesame oil to the wok; cook and stir red chile pepper and garlic in hot oil until sizzling, 15 to 30 seconds. Add onion and bell pepper; cook and stir until onion starts to soften, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir chopped bok choy stalks into onion mixture; cook and stir until stems begin to soften, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add broccoli to the wok; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add pork, chopped bok choy leaves, and soy sauce mixture; cook and stir until well-combined. Season pork mixture with ginger; cook and stir until bok choy leaves start to wilt and broccoli is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
